# NLP Text Classifier (Bug / Feature / Other)

This project is a simple NLP (Natural Language Processing) classifier that categorizes user issue sentences into three categories:

- **Bug**
- **Feature Request**
- **Other**

It uses the TF-IDF vectorization technique to convert text into numerical form and a Naive Bayes classifier for prediction.  
This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the basic NLP workflow.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Convert text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Train a classifier using **Naive Bayes**
- Predict category of new user inputs
- Simple dataset included (can be expanded)
- Easy to run inside a Python **virtual environment**

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/sharan-ux/nlp.git
cd nlp
`

### 2. Create a virtual environment


python -m venv venv


### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**Windows:**


venv\Scripts\activate


**macOS/Linux:**


source venv/bin/activate


### 4. Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt


If you do not have a `requirements.txt`, you can install manually:


pip install scikit-learn


---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. A small dataset of labeled sentences is provided
2. TF-IDF converts text → numerical vectors
3. Naive Bayes learns patterns from the examples
4. The classifier predicts the label for new sentences

---

## ▶️ Running the Model

Run the script:


python model.py


Expected output includes:

* Model accuracy
* Test predictions
* Predictions for new example sentences
